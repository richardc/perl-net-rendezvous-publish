=head1 NAME

Net::Rendezvous::Publish - publish Rendezvous services

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Net::Rendezvous::Publish;
 my $publisher = Net::Rendezvous::Publish->new
   or die "couldn't make a Responder object";
 my $service = $publisher->publish(
     name => "My HTTP Server",
     type => '_http._tcp',
     port => 12345,
 );
 while (1) { $publisher->step( 0.01 ) }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new publisher handle

=head2 publish( %definition )

Returns a Net::Rendezvous::Publish::Service object.  The following
keys are meaningful in the service definition hash.

=over

=item name

A descriptive name for the service.

=item type

The type of service.  This is string of the form _service._protocol.

=item port

The port on which you're advertising the service.  If you're not using
a port (and instead just using mDNS as a way of propogating other
service information) it's common practice to use 9 (the discard
service)

=item domain

The domain in which to advertise a service.  Defaults to C<local.>

=back

=head2 step( $seconds )

Spend at most $seconds seconds handling network events and updating
internal state.

=head TODO

At some point I may learn enough of the mDNS protocol to write a
pure-perl responder.  That'll be nifty.
